        AmeriCorps NCCC is a federal service program that matches non-profits
        with young adults who work and live onsite to provide critical services
        to communities in need. Project highlights include managing line control
        and securing patient appointments at the largest COVID-19 vaccine center
        in Brooklyn, writing grants for a STEM education ranch in rural Arizona,
        and constructing homes with Habitat for Humanity in a Missouri college
        town. Experience proved to be formative, both personally (humility,
        perseverance, compassion) and professionally (project management,
        teamwork, developing budgets, writing and communicating with clarity).
